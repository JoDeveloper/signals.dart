The idea for `connect` comes from Anguar Signals with RxJS:

Start with a signal and then use the `connect` method to create a connector.
Streams will feed Signal value.

```dart
final s = signal(0);
final c = connect(s);
```

### to

Add streams to the connector.

```dart
final s = signal(0);
final c = connect(s);

final s1 = Stream.value(1);
final s2 = Stream.value(2);

c.from(s1).from(s2); // These can be chained
```

### dispose

Cancel all subscriptions.

```dart
final s = signal(0);
final c = connect(s);

final s1 = Stream.value(1);
final s2 = Stream.value(2);

c.from(s1).from(s2);
// or
c << s1 << s2

c.dispose(); // This will cancel all subscriptions
```
