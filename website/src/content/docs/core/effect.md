The `effect` function is the last piece that makes everything reactive. When you access a signal inside its callback function, that signal and every dependency of said signal will be activated and subscribed to. In that regard it is very similar to [`computed(fn)`](/core/computed). By default all updates are lazy, so nothing will update until you access a signal inside `effect`.

```dart
import 'package:signals/signals.dart';

final name = signal("Jane");
final surname = signal("Doe");
final fullName = computed(() => name.value + " " + surname.value);

// Logs: "Jane Doe"
effect(() => print(fullName.value));

// Updating one of its dependencies will automatically trigger
// the effect above, and will print "John Doe" to the console.
name.value = "John";
```

You can destroy an effect and unsubscribe from all signals it was subscribed to, by calling the returned function.

```dart
import 'package:signals/signals.dart';

final name = signal("Jane");
final surname = signal("Doe");
final fullName = computed(() => name.value + " " + surname.value);

// Logs: "Jane Doe"
final dispose = effect(() => print(fullName.value));

// Destroy effect and subscriptions
dispose();

// Update does nothing, because no one is subscribed anymore.
// Even the computed `fullName` signal won't change, because it knows
// that no one listens to it.
surname.value = "Doe 2";
```

## Cleanup Callback

You can also return a cleanup function from an effect. This function will be called when the effect is destroyed.

```dart
import 'package:signals/signals.dart';

final s = signal(0);

final dispose = effect(() {
  print(s.value);
  return () => print('Effect destroyed');
});

// Destroy effect and subscriptions
dispose();
```

## On Dispose Callback

You can also pass a callback to `effect` that will be called when the effect is destroyed.

```dart
import 'package:signals/signals.dart';

final s = signal(0);

final dispose = effect(() {
  print(s.value);
}, onDispose: () => print('Effect destroyed'));

// Destroy effect and subscriptions
dispose();
```

## Preventing Cycles

:::danger
Mutating a signal inside an effect will cause an infinite loop, because the effect will be triggered again. To prevent this, you can use [`untracked(fn)`](/core/untracked) to read a signal without subscribing to it.

```dart
import 'dart:async';

import 'package:signals/signals.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final completer = Completer<void>();
  final age = signal(0);

  effect(() {
    print('You are ${age.value} years old');
    age.value++; // <-- This will throw a cycle error
  });

  await completer.future;
}
```
